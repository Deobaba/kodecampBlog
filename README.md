kodecamp blog-API
Create a blog API that supports:
1. User authentication (session or token) with any database of your choice

 

2. Fetching all blog posts (any user whether logged in or not can view other users' posts but cannot delete or edit them.)
 
3. Fetch a single blog post (any user whether logged in or not can view another users' post but cannot delete or edit it.)
 

3. Create post (only an authenticated user should be able to create a post, and the post should be associated with his ID so that only the user can have edit and delete access to it.)

 

4. Edit post (only the author of the post can edit the post.)

 

5. Dele post (only the author of the post can delete the post.)

 

6. Tags ( a post will be associated with tags that can be used to categorize the post and also filter posts in the same category.)
